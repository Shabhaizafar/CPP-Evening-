Problem Statement: Hybrid Vehicle System
A hybrid car combines features of both electric vehicles and fuel-powered vehicles. You are required to design a C++ program using multiple inheritance to model this system.

Requirements:
Create a base class ElectricVehicle with a method chargeBattery() that prints "Charging battery...".

Create another base class FuelVehicle with a method refuel() that prints "Refueling gasoline...".

Create a derived class HybridCar that inherits from both ElectricVehicle and FuelVehicle.

The HybridCar class should have a method drive() that prints "Driving using both battery and fuel engine."

In the main() function:

Create an object of HybridCar.

Call all three methods (chargeBattery(), refuel(), and drive()) to demonstrate multiple inheritance.

Example Output:

Charging battery...
Refueling gasoline...
Driving using both battery and fuel engine.
